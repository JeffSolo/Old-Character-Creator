Character Creator

This is my first ever attempt at creating a GUI with python, and my single largest coding endeavor to date.

The idea is to help build characters for role playing games. 
It is intended for new players who don't want to spend time learning how to create characters from scratch, 
and is an aid for filling out player sheets.

In actually, it is mostly just a fun, selfish learning experiment for my own benefit - both creating
simplistic GUI's in python and familiarizing myself with git.
 
 Still very much a work-in-progress.
 
 Usage:
`python DND.py`
