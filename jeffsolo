# Character-Creator
D&amp;D Character Creator (3/3.5 hybrid)

This is my first ever attempt at creating a GUI with python, and my single largest coding endeavor to date.

The idea is to help build characters for D&D. 
It is intended for new players who don't want to spend time learning how to create characters from scratch, aiding them in filling out player sheets.

In actually, it is mostly just a fun, selfish learning experiment for my own benefit - both creating simplistic GUI's in python and familiarizing myself with git.
